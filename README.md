# Machine Learning in Nuclear Fusion
[Link to Article](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2022/september/char-nuclear-fusion.html)

This article talks about the use of reinforcement learning to control nuclear fusion reactions. A doctoral candidate nameed *Ian Char* used AI to control the hydrogen plasma of the [tokamak machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak). I found this quite interesting because machine learning is usually associated with unpredictability and inaccuracy at times. It is impossible to get perfect results. However, its use in the field of Nuclear energy really speaks for the advancements that the world has made in AI. AI is making significant and tangible contributions to various kinds of fields from computer graphics, biology, physics, etc.

### Comment: Very thoughtful response. It is really interesting to see the progress AI has made in recent years, and its uses in nuclear engineering. --- Krises Maskey
